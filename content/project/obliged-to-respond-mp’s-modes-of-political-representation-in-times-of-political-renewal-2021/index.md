  political renewal (2021)

summary: This chapter analyses the way in which Spanish MPs conceive their
  representative role following the breakdown of the party system and the
  emergence of two national parties with new social and political demands
  (*Podemos* and *Ciudadanos*). Street politics entered institutional (and
  parliamentary) politics, which implied substantial change for the traditional
  parties that were obliged to adapt by responding to frustrated voters.
