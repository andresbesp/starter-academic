This chapter analyses the way in which Spanish MPs conceive their representative role following the breakdown of the party system and the emergence of two national parties with new social and political demands (*Podemos* and *Ciudadanos*). Street politics entered institutional (and parliamentary) politics, which implied substantial change for the traditional parties that were obliged to adapt by responding to frustrated voters. This chapter inquires whether this change has been reflected in the way MPs understand their representative role. Specifically it analyses the possible differences between the new and traditional parties with respect to social ties, opinions about democracy, and preferred governmental model. In this context, it establishes whether or not MPs have been forced to be more receptive towards their electorate, social movements, and society as a whole. The results show that the incorporation of new parties into the parliamentary system has not caused a substantial change in the links between citizens and MPs, although it has improved responsiveness to political protest.
